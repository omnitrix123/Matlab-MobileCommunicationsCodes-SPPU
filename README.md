# Matlab-MobileCommunicationsCodes-SPPU
Matlab codes for Mobile Communications.
erlang.m is the code for lost call systems

anyaryPSK is the final code for last experiment. In this code changing the value of M to 2 will make it work for BPSK, M=4 for QPSK and so on
for any M-ary PSK. IF you will replace pskmod and pskdemod functions with qammod and qamdemod you will get required result(BER vs SNR) plot
for it.

ScatterPlot_qam is result of what ive told above.

ScatterPlot_qpsk is the demo code for qpsk.
